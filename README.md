## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed on your machine.

## Installation
Clone the repository or place the project files in a local directory.

Install dependencies. Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install Astro, React, and all other necessary packages.

## Running the Development Server
To run the project locally and see the interactive calculator, use the Astro development command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, typically at http://localhost:4321. Open this URL in your web browser to see the live application. The page will automatically reload as you make changes to the source files.
