A vehicle returns to a carbon recovery with a payload of weight P_r.
The payload weight P_r is shared evenly across a number of cartridges N_r, each with an average weight of C_ave.
Each cartridge has a base (empty) weight of C_base.
The remaining average weight of each cartridge is the contents C_contents = C_ave - C_base. 
Some ratio R_carbon (0:1) of the cartridge contents is carbon; we can assume this is constant and not a function of cartridge fullness.
R_carbon is a free parameter, based on the sorbent technology, its efficiency, etc. 
The amount of Carbon captured C_captured is given by R_carbon * C_contents * N_r

The vehicle has an emission factor F_e based on its fuel type (gasoline, diesel, electric) in kg CO2/(gallon | kwh).
The vehicle has an average fuel economy E_ave measured in miles / (gallon | kwh), depending on fuel type. 
The average fuel economy E_ave is a function of the unloaded economy of the vehicle, the inefficiency when fully loaded, and rate of weight change.
The vehicle traveled D_r miles.
The amount of Carbon Dioxide emitted in the carbon recovery CO2_recovery_emitted is E_ave * F_e * D_r. 
The amount of Carbon emitted by the recovery trip C_recovery_emitted is given by CO2_recovery_emitted * (weight of C / weight of CO2)

The same vehicle is also used to distribute fresh capture materials.
This trip is D_d miles and leaves with a payload weight of P_d, carrying N_d packages. 
Each package has some average weight W_ave.
The amount of Carbon emitted, C_distribution_emitted, by this trip follows the same math as the recovery trip.

The total carbon emissions are the sum of the recovery and distribution emissions.
The distribution emissions relate to the recovery emissions by a scalar multiple X.
The total carbon emissions is given by C_recovery_emitted + X * C_distribution_emitted
The ROI Ratio is Total Carbon Captured / Total Carbon Emissions.
